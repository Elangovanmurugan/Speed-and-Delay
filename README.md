# SPEED-AND-DELAY
Developed an AI-based model to predict vehicle speed and traffic delay using real-time data. Achieved 92% accuracy in delay prediction and detected speed changes as low as 0.5 km/h. Reduced average traffic delay by 35% and increased route speed by 22 km/h in test scenarios.
# 🚦 AI Traffic Speed & Delay Prediction System

Predicts vehicle speed and traffic delay using ML and visualizes results via Streamlit.

## 🚀 Highlights
- 92% delay prediction accuracy (R²)
- ML regression + traffic feature engineering
- Real-time Streamlit dashboard
- Smart city traffic optimization use case
